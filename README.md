## Learning React TDD

The goal of this project is to learn about test driving the development of a React app, so that I can apply a good development process to front end work I do.

I've used create-react-app to bootstrap the application, then modified it extensively, based on the tutorial from Pluralsight.
You can see the evolution of the app through the git commits.

## How to Install

1) Clone the project.
2) Run npm install to get all the dependencies.

## How to Run

1) npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to Test

1) npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

## Technology Used

I've used enzyme for shallow rendering of components, to enable components to be tested in isolation.

React 16.9
Enzyme 3.10.0

## Learning Resources Used

Pluralsight - Test Driven Development Using React

## Starting Point

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
